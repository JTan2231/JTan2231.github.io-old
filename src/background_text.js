Universally that person's acumen is esteemed very little perceptive concerning whatsoever matters are being held as most profitable by mortals with sapience endowed to be studied who is ignorant of that which the most in doctrine erudite and certainly by reason of that in them high mind's ornament deserving of veneration constantly maintain when by general consent they affirm that other circumstances being equal by no exterior splendour is the prosperity of a nation more efficaciously asserted than by the measure of how far forward may have progressed the tribute of its solicitude for that proliferent continuance which of evils the original if it be absent when fortunately present constitutes the certain sign of omnipollent nature's incorrupted benefaction. For who is there who anything of some significance has apprehended but is conscious that that exterior splendour may be the surface of a downwardtending lutulent reality or on the contrary anyone so is there inilluminated as not to perceive that as no nature's boon can contend against the bounty of increase so it behoves every most just citizen to become the exhortator and admonisher of his semblables and to tremble lest what had in the past been by the nation excellently commenced might be in the future not with similar excellence accomplished if an inverecund habit shall have gradually traduced the honourable by ancestors transmitted customs to that thither of profundity that that one was audacious excessively who would have the hardihood to rise affirming that no more odious offence can for anyone be than to oblivious neglect to consign that evangel simultaneously command and promise which on all mortals with prophecy of abundance or with diminution's menace that exalted of reiteratedly procreating function ever irrevocably enjoined?

It is not why therefore we shall wonder if, as the best historians relate, among the Celts, who nothing that was not in its nature admirable admired, the art of medicine shall have been highly honoured. Not to speak of hostels, leperyards, sweating chambers, plaguegraves, their greatest doctors, the O'Shiels, the O'Hickeys, the O'Lees, have sedulously set down the divers methods by which the sick and the relapsed found again health whether the malady had been trembling withering or loose boyconnell flux. Certainly in every public work which in it anything of gravity contains preparation should be with importance commensurate and therefore a plan was by them adopted (whether by having preconsidered or as the maturation of experience it is difficult in being said which the discrepant opinions of subsequent inquirers are not up to the present congrued to render manifest) whereby maternity was so far from all accident possibility removed that whatever care the patient in that allhardest of woman hour chiefly required and not solely for the copiously opulent but also for her who not being sufficiently moneyed scarcely and often not even scarcely could subsist valiantly and for an inconsiderable emolument was provided.

To her nothing already then and thenceforward was anyway able to be molestful for this chiefly felt all citizens except with proliferent mothers prosperity at all not to can be and as they had received eternity gods mortals generation to befit them her beholding, when the case was so having itself, parturient in vehicle the reward carrying desire immense among all one another was impelling on of her to be received into that domicile. O thing of prudent nation not merely in being seen but also even in being related worthy of being praised that they her by anticipation went seeing mother, that she by them suddenly to be about to be cherished had been begun she felt!

Before born babe bliss had. Within womb won he worship. Whatever in that one case done commodiously done was. A couch by midwives attended with wholesome food reposeful cleanest swaddles as though forthbringing were now done and by wise foresight set: but to this no less of what drugs there is need and surgical implements which are pertaining to her case not omitting aspect of all very distracting spectacles in various latitudes by our terrestrial orb offered together with images, divine and human, the cogitation of which by sejunct females is to tumescence conducive or eases issue in the high sunbright wellbuilt fair home of mothers when, ostensibly far gone and reproductitive, it is come by her thereto to lie in, her term up.

Some man that wayfaring was stood by housedoor at night's oncoming. Of Israel's folk was that man that on earth wandering far had fared. Stark ruth of man his errand that him lone led till that house.

Of that house A. Horne is lord. Seventy beds keeps he there teeming mothers are wont that they lie for to thole and bring forth bairns hale so God's angel to Mary quoth. Watchers they there walk, white sisters in ward sleepless. Smarts they still sickness soothing: in twelve moons thrice an hundred. Truest bedthanes they twain are, for Horne holding wariest ward.

In ward wary the watcher hearing come that man mild-hearted eft rising with swire ywimpled to him her gate wide undid. Lo, levin leaping lightens in eyeblink Ireland's westward welkin! Full she dread that God the Wreaker all mankind would fordo with water for his evil sins. Christ's rood made she on breastbone and him drew that he would rathe infare under her thatch. That man her will wotting worthful went in Horne's house.

Loth to irk in Horne's hall hat holding the seeker stood. On her stow he ere was living with dear wife and lovesome daughter that then over land and seafloor nine year had long outwandered. Once her in townhithe meeting he to her bow had not doffed. Her to forgive now he craved with good ground of her allowed that that of him swiftseen face, hers, so young then had looked. Light swift her eyes kindled, bloom of blushes his word winning.

As her eyes then ongot his weeds swart therefor sorrow she feared. Glad after she was that ere adread was. Her he asked if O'Hare Doctor tidings sent from far coast and she with grameful sigh him answered that O'Hare Doctor in heaven was. Sad was the man that word to hear that him so heavied in bowels ruthful. All she there told him, ruing death for friend so young, algate sore unwilling God's rightwiseness to withsay. She said that he had a fair sweet death through God His goodness with masspriest to be shriven, holy housel and sick men's oil to his limbs. The man then right earnest asked the nun of which death the dead man was died and the nun answered him and said that he was died in Mona island through bellycrab three year agone come Childermas and she prayed to God the Allruthful to have his dear soul in his undeathliness. He heard her sad words, in held hat sad staring. So stood they there both awhile in wanhope, sorrowing one with other.

Therefore, everyman, look to that last end that is thy death and the dust that gripeth on every man that is born of woman for as he came naked forth from his mother's womb so naked shall he wend him at the last for to go as he came.

The man that was come into the house then spoke to the nursingwoman and he asked her how it fared with the woman that lay there in childbed. The nursingwoman answered him and said that that woman was in throes now full three days and that it would be a hard birth unneth to bear but that now in a little it would be. She said thereto that she had seen many births of women but never was none so hard as was that woman's birth. Then she set it forth all to him that time was had lived nigh that house. The man hearkened to her words for he felt with wonder women's woe in the travail that they have of motherhood and he wondered to look on her face that was a young face for any man to see but yet was she left after long years a handmaid. Nine twelve bloodflows chiding her childless.

And whiles they spake the door of the castle was opened and there nighed them a mickle noise as of many that sat there at meat. And there came against the place as they stood a young learning knight yclept Dixon. And the traveller Leopold was couth to him sithen it had happed that they had had ado each with other in the house of misericord where this learning knight lay by cause the traveller Leopold came there to be healed for he was sore wounded in his breast by a spear wherewith a horrible and dreadful dragon was smitten him for which he did do make a salve of volatile salt and chrism as much as he might suffice. And he said now that he should go into that castle for to make merry with them that were there. And the traveller Leopold said that he should go otherwhither for he was a man of cautels and a subtle. Also the lady was of his avis and reproved the learning knight though she trowed well that the traveller had said thing that was false for his subtility. But the learning knight would not hear say nay nor do her mandement ne have him in aught contrarious to his list and he said how it was a marvellous castle. And the traveller Leopold went into the castle for to rest him for a space being sore of limb after many marches environing in divers lands and sometimes venery.

And in the castle was set a board that was of the birchwood of Finlandy and it was upheld by four dwarfmen of that country but they durst not move for enchantment. And on this board were frightful swords and knives that are made in a great cavern by swinking demons out of white flames that they fix in the horns of buffalos and stags that there abound marvellously. And there were vessels that are wrought by magic of Mahound out of seasand and the air by a warlock with his breath that he blares into them like to bubbles. And full fair cheer and rich was on the board that no wight could devise a fuller ne richer. And there was a vat of silver that was moved by craft to open in the which lay strange fishes withouten heads though misbelieving men nie that this be possible thing without they see it natheless they are so. And these fishes lie in an oily water brought there from Portugal land because of the fatness that therein is like to the juices of the olive press. And also it was marvel to see in that castle how by magic they make a compost out of fecund wheat kidneys out of Chaldee that by aid of certain angry spirits that they do into it swells up wondrously like to a vast mountain. And they teach the serpents there to entwine themselves up on long sticks out of the ground and of the scales of these serpents they brew out a brewage like to mead.

And the learning knight let pour for childe Leopold a draught and halp thereto the while all they that were there drank every each. And childe Leopold did up his beaver for to pleasure him and took apertly somewhat in amity for he never drank no manner of mead which he then put by and anon full privily he voided the more part in his neighbour glass and his neighbour wist not of his wile. And he sat down in that castle with them for to rest him there awhile. Thanked be Almighty God.`,

`
Now Gandalf led the way. “We must not miss the road, or we shall be done for,” 




he said. “We need food, for one thing, and rest in reasonable safety—also it is 
very necessary to tackle the Misty Mountains by the proper path, or else you will 
get lost in them, and have to come back and start at the beginning again (if you 
ever get back at all).” 

They asked him where he was making for, and he answered: “You are come 
to the very edge of the Wild, as some of you may know. Hidden somewhere 
ahead of us is the fair valley of Rivendell where Elrond lives in the Last Homely 
House. I sent a message by my friends, and we are expected.” 

That sounded nice and comforting, but they had not got there yet, and it was 
not so easy as it sounds to find the Last Homely House west of the Mountains. 
There seemed to be no trees and no valleys and no hills to break the ground in 
front of them, only one vast slope going slowly up and up to meet the feet of the 
nearest mountain, a wide land the colour of heather and crumbling rock, with 
patches and slashes of grass-green and moss-green showing where water might 
be. 

Morning passed, afternoon came; but in all the silent waste there was no sign 
of any dwelling. They were growing anxious, for they saw now that the house 
might be hidden almost anywhere between them and the mountains. They came 
on unexpected valleys, narrow with steep sides, that opened suddenly at their 
feet, and they looked down surprised to see trees below them and running water 
at the bottom. There were gullies that they could almost leap over, but very deep 
with waterfalls in them. There were dark ravines that one could neither jump 
over nor climb into. There were bogs, some of them green pleasant places to 
look at, with flowers growing bright and tall; but a pony that walked there with a 
pack on its back would never have come out again. 

It was indeed a much wider land from the ford to the mountains than ever 
you would have guessed. Bilbo was astonished. The only path was marked with 
white stones, some of which were small, and others were half covered with moss 
or heather. Altogether it was a very slow business following the track, even 
guided by Gandalf, who seemed to know his way about pretty well. 

His head and beard wagged this way and that as he looked for the stones, and 
they followed his lead, but they seemed no nearer to the end of the search when 
the day began to fail. Tea-time had long gone by, and it seemed supper-time 
would soon do the same. There were moths fluttering about, and the light 
became very dim, for the moon had not risen. Bilbo’s pony began to stumble 
over roots and stones. They came to the edge of a steep fall in the ground so 
suddenly that Gandalf’s horse nearly slipped down the slope. 



“Here it is at last!” he called, and the others gathered round him and looked 
over the edge. They saw a valley far below. They could hear the voice of 
hurrying water in a rocky bed at the bottom; the scent of trees was in the air; and 
there was a light on the valley-side across the water. 

Bilbo never forgot the way they slithered and slipped in the dusk down the 
steep zig-zag path into the secret valley of Rivendell. The air grew warmer as 
they got lower, and the smell of the pine-trees made him drowsy, so that every 
now and again he nodded and nearly fell off, or bumped his nose on the pony’s 
neck. Their spirits rose as they went down and down. The trees changed to beech 
and oak, and there was a comfortable feeling in the twilight. The last green had 
almost faded out of the grass, when they came at length to an open glade not far 
above the banks of the stream. 

“Hmmm! it smells like elves!” thought Bilbo, and he looked up at the stars. 
They were burning bright and blue. Just then there came a burst of song like 
laughter in the trees: O! What are you doing, 

And where are you going? 
Your ponies need shoeing! 
The river is flowing! 

O! tra-la-la-lally 

here down in the valley! 


O! What are you seeking, 
And where are you making ? 
The faggots are reeking, 

The bannocks are baking! 
O! tril-lil-lil-lolly 
the valley is jolly, 
ha! ha! 


O! Where are you going 
With beards all a-wagging? 
No knowing, no knowing 
What brings Mister Baggins 



And Balin and Dwalin 
down into the valley 
in June 
ha! ha! 


O! Will you be staying, 

Or will you be flying? 

Your ponies are straying! 
The daylight is dying! 

To fly would be folly, 

To stay would be jolly 
And listen and hark 
Till the end of the dark 
to our tune 
ha! ha! 


So they laughed and sang in the trees; and pretty fair nonsense I daresay you 
think it. Not that they would care; they would only laugh all the more if you told 
them so. They were elves of course. Soon Bilbo caught glimpses of them as the 
darkness deepened. He loved elves, though he seldom met them; but he was a 
little frightened of them too. Dwarves don’t get on well with them. Even decent 
enough dwarves like Thorin and his friends think them foolish (which is a very 
foolish thing to think), or get annoyed with them. For some elves tease them and 
laugh at them, and most of all at their beards. 

“Well, well!” said a voice. “Just look! Bilbo the hobbit on a pony, my dear! 
Isn’t it delicious!” 

“Most astonishing wonderful!” 

Then off they went into another song as ridiculous as the one I have written 
down in full. At last one, a tall young fellow, came out from the trees and bowed 
to Gandalf and to Thorin. 

“Welcome to the valley!” he said. 

“Thank you!” said Thorin a bit gruffly; but Gandalf was already off his horse 
and among the elves, talking merrily with them. 

“You are a little out of your way,” said the elf: “that is, if you are making for 
the only path across the water and to the house beyond. We will set you right, 
but you had best get on foot, until you are over the bridge. Are you going to stay 



a bit and sing with us, or will you go straight on? Supper is preparing over 
there,” he said. “I can smell the wood-fires for the cooking.” Tired as he was, Bilbo would have liked to stay a while. Elvish singing is not 
a thing to miss, in June under the stars, not if you care for such things. Also he 
would have liked to have a few private words with these people that seemed to 
know his names and all about him, although he had never seen them before. He 
thought their opinion of his adventure might be interesting. Elves know a lot and 
are wondrous folk for news, and know what is going on among the peoples of 
the land, as quick as water flows, or quicker. 

But the dwarves were all for supper as soon as possible just then, and would 
not stay. On they all went, leading their ponies, till they were brought to a good 
path and so at last to the very brink of the river. It was flowing fast and noisily, 
as mountain-streams do of a summer evening, when sun has been all day on the 
snow far up above. There was only a narrow bridge of stone without a parapet, 
as narrow as a pony could well walk on; and over that they had to go, slow and 
careful, one by one, each leading his pony by the bridle. The elves had brought 
bright lanterns to the shore, and they sang a merry song as the party went across. 

“Don’t dip your beard in the foam, father!” they cried to Thorin, who was 
bent almost on to his hands and knees. “It is long enough without watering it.” 

“Mind Bilbo doesn’t eat all the cakes!” they called. “He is too fat to get 
through key-holes yet!” 

“Hush, hush! Good People! and good night!” said Gandalf, who came last. 
“Valleys have ears, and some elves have over merry tongues. Good night!” 

And so at last they all came to the Last Homely House, and found its doors 
flung wide. 


Now it is a strange thing, but things that are good to have and days that are 
good to spend are soon told about, and not much to listen to; while things that 
are uncomfortable, palpitating, and even gruesome, may make a good tale, and 
take a deal of telling anyway. They stayed long in that good house, fourteen days 
at least, and they found it hard to leave. Bilbo would gladly have stopped there 
for ever and ever—even supposing a wish would have taken him right back to 
his hobbit-hole without trouble. Yet there is little to tell about their stay. 

The master of the house was an elf-friend—one of those people whose 
fathers came into the strange stories before the beginning of History, the wars of 
the evil goblins and the elves and the first men in the North. In those days of our 



tale there were still some people who had both elves and heroes of the North for 
ancestors, and Elrond the master of the house was their chief.
