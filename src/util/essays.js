        `A neural network, the family AI algorithms that run many modern recommendation and computer vision systems, is just a really good function approximator. It never gets the exact representation of the function – even nature can’t do that – but it often gets closer than any other methods we have come up with. This function could be that which determines what YouTube videos you would be most inclined to watch next. Its inputs would be what you have previously watched, and its outputs would be the videos that show up in your recommendation feed. Imagine a blurry image increasing in clarity as the function approaches a better approximation, or your increasing understanding as you get better at a certain skill.`,
        `Inputs are thrown into the function and transformed into whatever the outputs may be. This idea of functions representing transformations – your YouTube watch history (input) → your YouTube recommendation feed (output) – is immensely powerful because it can be used to model basically everything going on in the world, and the success of neural networks is representative of that idea. (Wittgenstein, Plato, theory of forms?)`,
        `Aside from being a neat and useful set of algorithms, I think neural networks are mathematical analogs to the biological mechanisms which govern our minds and bodies. There are countless methods and techniques that go into the training and creation of these networks that have an uncanny symmetry with our own best methods of learning and ways of thinking. A thorough understanding of the systems which make successful neural networks may yield a similar understanding of our own biological systems.`,
        `Perception is one such concept embedded deep within the symmetries between ourselves and neural networks. Physically, one’s perspective is a matter of where they stand in the real world. But this concept of perception also carries over to the way we think about things. Phrases like “I see what you mean” are explicit expressions linking our own concept of perception and the understanding of another’s ideas. `,
        `Perception changes when we ourselves move around, or when we manipulate the subject at hand. In high school geometry, we learn about things like translations (sliding things around), rotations, and reflections. These transformations are actions used to manipulate a given shape and can be used to give a new perspective to it. We can rotate a Rubik’s Cube to uncover a previously hidden red-colored side; reflect ( reflect | tcelfer ) a word to defamiliarize the familiar.`,
        `The fundamental mathematical operation of neural networks deals entirely with perspective. Simple neural networks are essentially a series of matrices by which an input is multiplied. An input goes in as one matrix and leaves the other side as another. Coincidentally, geometric transformations are often represented in matrices to accommodate higher dimensions. One could use matrices to increase the dimensionality of another matrix (e.g. 3D → 6D), or, in a perspective frame of mind, the same object looked at with different variables. The latter part of the previous sentence is itself representative of this idea, in that framing the increasing of dimensionality in perspectives is the same concept, composed differently. In other words, a simple neural network can be thought of as a series of internal perspectives of the input. Each successive multiplication between the network and the input yields a new matrix, one whose shape and numbers may be different while still representing the idea originally presented to the network in the input. The output is the final perspective, the input through the eyes of the algorithm.`,
        `Our perspective regarding any topic is a measure of how much we have learned about it and our confidence in what we have learned. A small town prodigy could enter the big city only to be crushed by more universally prodigious individuals. A competitive grandmaster seizes with great confidence opportunities forever lost on those outside of the game. A solitary hobbyist could have an unrivaled expertise, unbeknownst to himself and the rest of the world.`,
        `This perspective is expanded through experience and learning. Expert opinions matter because they are borne of years of experience–knowledge gained only through exposure. To read and understand is different than to think[1] and understand. The former yields foreign connections unnatural to your existing mind; the latter yields an organic perspective cultivated from the fruits of your own interpretation. To learn something is to see it differently. To learn something is to add to one’s repertoire those perspectives that allow you to see more clearly that which may have been previously invisible.`,
        `In training a neural network, it behooves the practitioner to use as large a dataset as possible. In other words, provide as diverse a set of experiences to the model as you possibly can. This usually increases the performance of the model in its native domain as well as its generalizability to unfamiliar data. It expands the perspective of the model. The model which sees more is the model that is capable of more. It scores higher on tests. It produces more consistent and robust results in the face of uncertainty or unfamiliarity. Unless experimental results suggest otherwise, one should always strive for the largest dataset possible.`,
        `Some of the most influential people in history had a record of cultivating many intellectual pursuits. Various rulers of the Renaissance – Ferrante of Naples, the Medici family of Florence, Mehmed the Conqueror of the Ottoman Empire – dumped enormous sums of money into the copying and preservation of ancient manuscripts. Great mercenary warlord, Federico da Montefeltro, had ambitions to assemble a library “so vast, and so select, / As to supply each intellect and taste,” (Quoted in James Dennistoun, Memoirs of the Dukes of Urbino, vol. 1, p. 164). The personal libraries of these rulers were boasted to be among the best in the world. Many of the pioneering 20th century physicists invested themselves heavily in humanities to accompany their scientific inquiry. Robert Oppenheimer spent his free time reading and writing poetry like, for example, the Bhagavad Gita in its native Sanskrit. Einstein famously played violin at a world-class level. Max Planck was similarly talented on the piano.`,
        `In working toward set goals, one should be careful not to forget the vision which started the goal in the first place. Ruling dynasties may start with the intention of securing their family’s power as well as empowering their native people, only to fall into moral decay and political impotence after a few generations. Similarly, on a shorter timescale and with fewer consequences, one might set out to do their homework on the computer, only to get lost in a labyrinth of capitalist attention traps. Those who successfully avoid such things often have signals, internal or otherwise, set up to remind them of their origin. A memoir, message, or similarly sentimental object or memory to serve as a reminder to stay focused on their mission, lest they lose their way and fall into darkness. `,
        `Predictably, successful neural networks have a similar mechanism for boosting performance during and after training. In a simple network, as discussed before, it may just be a series of matrices by which the input is multiplied. A slightly more complex, and likely more successful, version might introduce the concept of residuals, which add to the result of a matrix multiplication the previous input. In adding the input to the output, we are left with a cumulation of the two. The end result builds on the previous ideas, but doesn’t increase complexity. The dimensionality of perspective is unchanged. Rather, it serves as an explicit remnant of the network’s previous thoughts. A residual signal of the original perspective that initiated the thinking and doing.`,
        `In training a neural network, we are guiding it around a hugely multidimensional object, the shape of which can only be determined through myriad perspectives. Likewise, in learning something we are taking ourselves through many different perspectives, integrating (with varying degrees) the perspectives of both our predecessors and our own observations.`,
        `[1]: To think and understand refers to the action of actively doing and/or thinking through something. This uses the assumption that in deliberately doing something, you’re actively thinking about what you’re doing.`

        `A few weeks ago, I got obsessed with the idea of fractility in nature, both physically and abstractly. The idea of repeating patterns in different areas seemed absolutely amazing because I felt like I had been seeing it all my life. That, and having seen things before relating fractalism and architecture (source to come), led me to the following tweet:`,
        `"A solution exists to a problem iff both the solution and problem exist elsewhere in a different context and I refuse to believe anything otherwise."`,
        `Essentially, this means that every "problem" (goal, objective) and "solution" (means by which you achieve the goal/objective) is already there, just in a different context. Aptly solving your own problems means mapping problem/solution pairs from other domains to your own. The inability to do so either means that the problem/solution pair doesn't exist, or you just haven't found the mapping/right pair yet.`,
        `This relates a bit to Plato's Theory of Forms, where every object/idea/concept/whatever has a "form" that links all of whatever object/idea/concept/whatever together. For example, we know that tables generally have some kind of supports (legs, but not always) to stand on as well as a surface on which things can rest. But the details for each and every table can vary so widely that it's impossible to totally categorize every single type of table. In fact, I think this inability to totally categorize every facet of a "form" is in itself a form. This inability crops up as a complaint of literally every attempt to categorize things. Most prominent examples that come to mind are stereotypes of people and the sciences.`,
        `I think Ludwig Wittgenstein inadvertantly wrote about this in his Tractatus Logico-Philosophus with his first statement: "The world is everything that is the case." Nothing more can be stated about the world which isn't already stated. John Gall repeated this sentiment, in more straightforward terms, in his treatise on systems engineering, Systemantics: The Systems Bible, "The system is its own best explanation."`,
        `In a way this is similar to Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle in quantum physics, which essentially means that the more preciesly we know a particle's position, the less precisely we know that same particle's momentum, and vice versa. Mapped to the context of our current discussion, I believe it means that [more topic precision takes away from generalizability, and vice versa? still not sure yet].`,
        `Is this generally useful? I have no idea. At the very least, it has given me the confidence to tackle basically any problem without fear of total failure. After all, it does imply that excellence in one field means the possibility of excellence in another. On the other hand, it could just be the abstract nonsense for which philosophers are most commonly hated. Regardless this is going to be something I will continue thinking about as I have found it most useful and would like to extract a more practical application for it.`,
