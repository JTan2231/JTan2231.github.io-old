What was this banquet, what was this great everlasting feast, to which he had long been drawn, always, ever since childhood, and which he could never join?

[`6 Habits of Super Learners

==Read a lot==
Reading is exercise for your mind. It allows us to roam the expanse of space, time, history, and offer a deeper view of ideas, concepts, emotions, and body of knowledge.

==View learning as a process==
Learning is a journey, not a destination. Keep mastering new principles, processes, worldviews, thinking models, etc. 

==Adopt a growth mindset==
A growth mindset is a learning theory that revolves around the belief that you can improve intelligence, ability, and performance.

==Teach others what you know==
Learners retain 90% of what they learn when they explain/teach the concept to someone else, or use it immediately. The ultimate test of your knowledge is your capacity to transfer it to another.

==Take care of your brain==
The health of your brain can significantly change how you record, process, and retrieve information. Eat foods that prevent cognitive decline: blueberries, leafy greens, whole grains, protein from fish and legumes, unsaturated fats.

==Take short breaks, early and often==
Downtime is crucial to retaining anything you learn. Taking breaks gives your brain time to recover, helps you learn better, and improves your retention rate.

[[`(Opening remarks for the “Stay Core, Stay Poor” panel to conclude the 2019 Pushing Boarders conference in Malmö, Sweden. Delivered August 18, 2019. Panelists: Josh Friedberg, Kim Woozy, Paul Shier, Nick Sharrat, and Claire Alleaume.)

My name is Kyle Beachy. I’m a novelist and a professor of literature and creative writing, neither of which professions have anything to do with the skateboard industry.

But about seven or eight years ago I began writing articles about skateboarding because I had been doing it for a very long time and I was thinking about it basically all the time, due to a novel I was writing. At first I wrote about a few skaters who struck me as particularly important. I wrote about Nike’s insidious and totally obvious strategy to work their way into a skateboarding market that had already rebuffed them twice.

And last year I wrote an article that began with some old though no less despicable comments from a white California skateboard legend that were unearthed in the wake of a late-career Thrasher cover and his ending part in a Converse video. But the comments weren’t surprising, given American racial dynamics, and I wasn’t interested in cancelling or harming the man himself.

Really I wrote about my profound disappointment in the way that the US skateboarding industry responded to these comments with just overwhelming silence. What the incident made clear was that the industry as it stood did not have the infrastructure in place to adequately address the racism, misogyny, and homophobia that have always lurked in the back corners of skateboarding, and often in plain sight.

…

When I was young, before I understood my self or my body, skateboarding taught me what it means to long, to yearn, to fantasize. Skateboarding opened me to longing even before it was complicated by adolescence and sexual desires. I longed for a place I had never been, and worshipped a handful of impossibly, world-historically cool young men that I would never meet.

And this longing changed but lingered into adulthood. I recall a period of a few weeks in 2002 or 2003 when I had a recurring dream of PJ Ladd. In these dreams he was just nearby, wearing an Es hoodie, baggy denim and his Accels. We weren’t even skating. We were just kicking it. Like in basement or on a porch. And each morning I would wake to terrible sudden comprehension that it was just a dream, that PJ was not, actually, my homie.

This is what the skate industry did to me: it shaped my dreams, was the algorithm of my desires, and was just profoundly instrumental in the way I conceptualize my identity. It’s given me fashion, music, jokes. And for me and a lot of other people who look like me, skating has been by far the most culturally interesting thing about us.

Ever since I achieved the slightest modicum of self-awareness, self-actualization, and, more recently, actively sought out various forms of therapies to assist me with mental and emotional health, I have always leaned upon skateboarding as a foundational text of my personal narrative.

…

I have an impossible goal right now: to have this panel serve as a kind of culmination to this week’s wildly interesting and important conversations. And in a way, it will be, because has to be. And here’s what I mean by that.

Much of this conference has been about the different ways that skateboarding creates or facilitates meaning. What skateboarding means for individuals like me, and many other individuals who are totally unlike me. What it means for cities, places, for history itself. Also this week we’ve heard people speak of strategies for leveraging the practice, the activity of skateboarding into other uses—education, activism, therapy—and we’ve discussed difficult realities about who gets to chronicle skateboarding and tell its stories. We’ve confronted the broader social truths of power disparities and many, assorted forms of imbalance and injustice. We’ve brushed against the sacred, we’ve applauded latecomers, and listened to the voices of people we might otherwise assume are simply grateful for Western help.

But just as all questions of contemporary suffering are ultimately questions of capitalism, all of these things we’ve discussed about skateboarding—its promise, its utility, its fundamental weirdness and unquantifiability—are, at core, dependent on the production, distribution, and marketing of skateboard products. And as we here go about our work to both understand and redefine the ways skateboarding matters, we absolutely must keep in mind the relationship between our ideas, our noble practices, and the economic realities of our beloved little toy.

And so, here we have a cross section of the contemporary skate industry. Who, like us, have witnessed the conversations this week. Who, like us, are skaters. Who, like us, love skateboarding. And who, perhaps more and perhaps less than us, play a role in writing skateboarding’s ongoing narrative.

And now we get to have a conversation, which is as close as we get to the divine. I hope to move this conversation through four main parts.

We’re going to start with questions about “core” and what, if anything, that word means today. Then we’ll discuss SB’s growth and exposure in new parts of the world, and touch on the question of gatekeeping. We’ll address what this growth means to people who skateboard professionally and also casually, including questions about ethical treatments and practices. And then we’ll discuss SB’s future in a world teetering on the brink of apocalypse.


So, now. To utter those famous, perfect words: let’s do this. `,5254954],
[`“Public libraries might at first glance seem like an odd example. They are, after all, a durable institution found in all capitalist societies. Nevertheless, they embody principles of access and distribution which are profoundly anticapitalist. Consider the sharp difference between the ways a person acquires access to a book in a bookstore and in a library. In a bookstore you look for the book you want on a shelf, check the price, and if you can afford it and you want it sufficiently, you go to the cashier, hand over the required amount of money and then leave with the book. In a library you go to the shelf (or more likely these days, to a terminal to see if the book is available), find your book, go to the check-out counter, show your library card, and leave with the book. If the book is already checked out, you get put on a waiting list. In a bookstore the distribution principle is “to each according to ability to pay”; in a public library the principle of distribution is “to each according to need”. What is more, in the library, if there is an imbalance between supply and demand, the amount of time one has to wait for the book increases; books in scarce supply are rationed by time, not by price. A waiting list is a profoundly egalitarian device: a day in everyone’s life is treated as morally equivalent. A well-resourced library will treat the length of the waiting list as a good signal that more copies of a particular book need to be ordered. Libraries can also become multipurpose public amenities, not simply repositories of books. Good libraries provide public space for meetings, sometimes venues for concerts and other performances, and a congenial gathering place for people. Of course, libraries can also be exclusionary zones that are made inhospitable to certain kinds of people. They can be elitist in their budget priorities and their rules. Actual libraries may thus reflect quite contradictory values. But, insofar as they embody emancipatory ideals of equality, democracy and community, libraries are a real utopia.”

The graphic design of this store is focused around having next to none, which saves resources on advertising, packaging, and creating of designed objects. The items have minimal packaging, primarily just a label or craft paper, and often nothing at all.

When visiting a Muji store, what’s remarkable is the bare products on wooden shelves. Compare this to a place like Bed, Bath and Beyond, which also features floor to ceiling products, but completely wrapped in plastic or boxed up. These products are also notably plain, made of natural materials, and of high quality. Muji describes it’s items as following: “Product design is not a medium for emphasizing the individuality of lifestyles of designers or end users; A Muji product’s shape is determined by its purpose and by continuous refinement over a long period of time.”

I thought about Muji as a sustainable brand when I was reading “Super Normal” by Jasper Morrison. The idea of leaving out design as sustainable seemed to me to make sense. Basic design saves of labor, making new design resources, and elaborate packaging or advertising. I first thought of Canada’s “No Name” brand. These food items are packaged in yellow containers with their names written on them in Helvetica, but with no branding. However, that company seemed to not be sustainable in its production practices, unlike Muji. Muji sources sustainable, recycled, and high quality resources. They also emphasize cutting down on waste, and often sell items that may not be seen in a regular store (such as the leftover ends of pasta from manufacturing.)

[`&gt; If you want to love what you do, abandon the passion mindset ("what can the world offer me?") and instead adopt the craftsman mindset ("what can I offer the world?")
&gt; 
&gt; The deep questions driving the passion mindset - "Who am I?" and "What do truly love?"- are essentially impossible to confirm. "Is this who I really am?" and "Do I love this?" rarely reduce to a clear yes-or-no response. In other words, the passion mindset is almost guaranteed to keep you perpetually unhappy and confused
&gt; 
&gt; The strongest predictor of someone seeing their work as a calling is the number of years spent on the job. The more experience they have, the more likely they are to love their work. The happiest, most passionate employees are not those who followed their passion into a position, but instead those who have been around long enough to become good at what they do.
&gt; 
&gt; The things that make a great job great, I discovered, are rare and valuable. If you want them in your working life, you need something rare and valuable to offer in return. In other words, you need to be good at something before you can expect a good job.
&gt; 
&gt; If "follow your passion" is bad advice, what should I do instead? Passion is an epiphenomenon of a working life well lived. Don't follow your passion; rather, let it follow you in your quest to become so good that they can't ignore you. Move your focus away from finding the right work, toward working right, and eventually build a love for what you do.

[`I’m interested in the possibility of a redemptive intimacy developing between strangers who agree to enter a relationship — not necessarily romantic — premised on unvarnished and intentional truth telling about our traumas and fears from the conception of the series of interactions. To turn inward and reveal who we really are and what we need in this moment, almost like descending from the mountaintop rather than climbing up it. The descent requires its own form of acclimatisation and is not to be underestimated. It’s intriguing to me then: working backwards from the most fundamental parts about me rather than trading high school anecdotes and much later, perhaps, the first instance of violence. I am also curious about how an awareness of a relationship being framed as an experiment impacts or directs the interactions that unfold. What festers at the root might be this: By removing judgment, do we create atmospheres ripe for flourishing? By laying out margins for trial and error from the outset, simple human flaw, do we craft a different type of relationship... one that is unthreatened and worthwhile? I want to disrupt the linearity of the ways we can relate to each other.

How does a shared history with people from formative periods of our lives impact the people we are trying to become now? Can personal links to that actually hinder the healing process and cloud present judgment based on the past? My recent self-examination has circled around freeing myself from my own past and baggage and whether embarking on that is as simple as a resilient mindset.&nbsp;I have often felt more freedom with the stranger, the person who has no direct connection to my histories: the places I have lived, my parents and friends, school and college. Inaccurate reputations and yes, past lovers. Maybe this freedom arises because there is no element of obligation nor expectation nor fear — no judgment and at least initially, caring about whether they like me or not. This allows me to be painfully honest. What if we could say to each other: I want to enter a mutual process of deconstruction with you, starting with the things I am most ashamed of.

Could we help each other grow sustainably? Let’s break away from the immediate gratification of certain connections and instead cultivate joy, healing, connection — free from attachment?`,8153564],

[[`One reason that successful and prolific singer-songwriters are prolific is that as soon as they’ve written a song, they can record it and publish it.

And a huge advantage of having a daily blog is that the software is always open, waiting for you to write something.

Your story doesn’t have to be a book, it is simply your chance to make a difference. “Here’s what I see, here’s how you can be part of it.”

When we remove the pre (finding the pen, the paper, the notebook, the software) and the post (finding a way to publish it), it turns out that we write more often, and writing more often leads to writing better.

It doesn’t have to be perfect, it can simply be the next thing you do.

The patterns matter. Streaks work.

All part of your practice.`,9893363],
[`I once read this great blogpost that used the analogy of keeping your inventory low. The author used inventory as an metaphor for things that you’re currently waiting on, the preconditions that need to be fulfilled before you act. For example, I want to hear about back this job before I apply for others. Or I need to lose weight before I wear this dress. Or, I need to have closure from my crush before I can move on and start dating other people. To be clear, sometimes the preconditions are real, but often they aren’t and you don’t actually need to wait for X to happen before you do Y. One way of keeping inventory low is to set self-imposed deadlines: if I don’t hear back in a week, I move on. Or you could just decide that the precondition doesn’t really matter.`,12195555],
[`A&nbsp;**desire path**&nbsp;(also known as a&nbsp;**desire line**&nbsp;or&nbsp;**social trail**) is a path developed by erosion caused by footfall. The path usually represents the shortest or most easily navigated route between an origin and destination. The width and amount of erosion of the line represents the amount of demand.

Desire paths can usually be found as shortcuts where constructed pathways take a circuitous route.

They are manifested on the surface of the earth in certain cases, e.g., as dirt pathways created by people walking through a field, when the original movement by individuals helps clear a path, thereby encouraging more travel. Explorers may tread a path through foliage or grass, leaving a trail "of least resistance" for followers.`,3842],

[[`What’s the point of sorting the silverware when you empty the dishwasher–why not simply put all of it in the drawer in a random order, and then pick out the cutlery you need when you need it? It’s the same amount of sorting, after all.

We intuitively understand the reason. If you take a minute to sort the forks, knives and spoons all at once, you won’t have to spend ten seconds every single time you want to find a fork.

The cost of changing gears is higher than we give it credit for. The web has persuaded us that everything is miscellaneous, that sorting things carefully and keeping them where they belong is a waste of time–because we can simply find them when we need them.

But switching to ‘find mode’ breaks our rhythm and eliminates the useful serendipity that happens when the right things are near each other, right where we expect them to be.`,10133908],
[`When you are young and healthy, you believe you will live forever. People tell you “the world is your oyster,” “the sky is the limit,” and so on. And you are willing to delay gratification—to invest years, for example, in gaining skills and resources for a brighter future. You seek to plug into bigger streams of knowledge and information. You widen your networks of friends and connections, instead of hanging out with your mother. When horizons are measured in decades, which might as well be infinity to human beings, you most desire all that stuff at the top of Maslow’s pyramid—achievement, creativity, and other attributes of “self-actualization.” But as your horizons contract—when you see the future ahead of you as finite and uncertain—your focus shifts to the here and now, to everyday pleasures and the people closest to you.

[[`Make the announcement louder. Make the logo bigger. Yell. Call more people on the phone to sell them an extended warranty. Send more emails. Hustle harder.

None of it works.

The problem with the fountain isn’t that they didn’t make a big enough sign. The problem is that the fountain itself is poorly designed. It’s an attractive nuisance, a dangerous thing to put in the middle of a boring courtyard. The sides invite sitting and standing, and the height beckons people to walk in and around it. And the consistent cues of its design aren’t going to be undone by an ugly, intrusive sign, even one in red with ALL CAPS.

And louder and more persistent PA announcements aren’t going to help if the situation people are in has lulled them into not listening.

And a bigger logo isn’t going to get someone to care about your company if the product and your story don’t resonate with them.

Insisting on a bigger interruption is lazy. It’s lazy because if you really cared about solving the problem, you’d change the situation, not yell about it.

If you get the design right, you can whisper instead.`,12725498],

[[`"The art of living is based on rhythm — on give and take, ebb and flow, light and dark, life and death. By acceptance of all aspects of life, good and bad, right and wrong, yours and mine, the static, defensive life, which is what most people are cursed with, is converted into a dance, ‘the dance of life,’ metamorphosis. One can dance to sorrow or to joy; one can even dance abstractly. … But the point is that, by the mere act of dancing, the elements which compose it are transformed; the dance is an end in itself, just like life. The acceptance of the situation, any situation, brings about a flow, a rhythmic impulse towards self-expression. To relax is, of course, the first thing a dancer has to learn. It is also the first thing a patient has to learn when he confronts the analyst. It is the first thing any one has to learn in order to live. It is extremely difficult, because it means surrender, full surrender."`,8578756],
[`When you’re deeply sensitive, love is ecstasy. Music is godlike. Heartache is a wide, somatic wound. Visual natural beauty is jewel-drenched, wild bliss. Tension and conflict are muscle tightening and toxic, straight down to the cells. So how do you hold it all? You rinse, re-centre, and remain clear. You recycle your sensitivity by propelling yourself and others to create waves of change in a super starving world. Direct your passion by spreading your heart only across what clearly matters most. Surround yourself with the souls and spaces that groove alongside your own- the ones that also desire to chase the beauty, courage and freedom we’re all here to teach each other. Choose love over fear and let go of all the rest, breathing what isn’t best for you straight out of your bones. Remember-there is power in the body. Harness it for the greater good, and allow nothing confusing, peace disrupting, or hurtful stand in its way.
