A couch by midwives attended with wholesome food reposeful cleanest swaddles as though forthbringing were now done and by wise foresight set: but to this no less of what drugs there is need and surgical implements which are pertaining to her case not omitting aspect of all very distracting spectacles in various latitudes by our terrestrial orb offered together with images, divine and human, the cogitation of which by sejunct females is to tumescence conducive or eases issue in the high sunbright wellbuilt fair home of mothers when, ostensibly far gone and reproductitive, it is come by her thereto to lie in, her term up.\n\nSome man that wayfaring was stood by housedoor at night's oncoming. Of Israel's folk was that man that on earth wandering far had fared. Stark ruth of man his errand that him lone led till that house.\n\nOf that house A. Horne is lord. Seventy beds keeps he there teeming mothers are wont that they lie for to thole and bring forth bairns hale so God's angel to Mary quoth. Watchers they there walk, white sisters in ward sleepless. Smarts they still sickness soothing: in twelve moons thrice an hundred. Truest bedthanes they twain are, for Horne holding wariest ward.\n\nIn ward wary the watcher hearing come that man mild-hearted eft rising with swire ywimpled to him her gate wide undid. Lo, levin leaping lightens in eyeblink Ireland's westward welkin! Full she dread that God the Wreaker all mankind would fordo with water for his evil sins. Christ's rood made she on breastbone and him drew that he would rathe infare under her thatch. That man her will wotting worthful went in Horne's house.\n\nLoth to irk in Horne's hall hat holding the seeker stood. On her stow he ere was living with dear wife and lovesome daughter that then over land and seafloor nine year had long outwandered. Once her in townhithe meeting he to her bow had not doffed. Her to forgive now he craved with good ground of her allowed that that of him swiftseen face, hers, so young then had looked. Light swift her eyes kindled, bloom of blushes his word winning.\n\nAs her eyes then ongot his weeds swart therefor sorrow she feared. Glad after she was that ere adread was. Her he asked if O'Hare Doctor tidings sent from far coast and she with grameful sigh him answered that O'Hare Doctor in heaven was. Sad was the man that word to hear that him so heavied in bowels ruthful. All she there told him, ruing death for friend so young, algate sore unwilling God's rightwiseness to withsay. She said that he had a fair sweet death through God His goodness with masspriest to be shriven, holy housel and sick men's oil to his limbs. The man then right earnest asked the nun of which death the dead man was died and the nun answered him and said that he was died in Mona island through bellycrab three year agone come Childermas and she prayed to God the Allruthful to have his dear soul in his undeathliness. He heard her sad words, in held hat sad staring. So stood they there both awhile in wanhope, sorrowing one with other.\n\nTherefore, everyman, look to that last end that is thy death and the dust that gripeth on every man that is born of woman for as he came naked forth from his mother's womb so naked shall he wend him at the last for to go as he came.\n\nThe man that was come into the house then spoke to the nursingwoman and he asked her how it fared with the woman that lay there in childbed. The nursingwoman answered him and said that that woman was in throes now full three days and that it would be a hard birth unneth to bear but that now in a little it would be. She said thereto that she had seen many births of women but never was none so hard as was that woman's birth. Then she set it forth all to him that time was had lived nigh that house. The man hearkened to her words for he felt with wonder women's woe in the travail that they have of motherhood and he wondered to look on her face that was a young face for any man to see but yet was she left after long years a handmaid. Nine twelve bloodflows chiding her childless.\n\nAnd whiles they spake the door of the castle was opened and there nighed them a mickle noise as of many that sat there at meat. And there came against the place as they stood a young learning knight yclept Dixon. And the traveller Leopold was couth to him sithen it had happed that they had had ado each with other in the house of misericord where this learning knight lay by cause the traveller Leopold came there to be healed for he was sore wounded in his breast by a spear wherewith a horrible and dreadful dragon was smitten him for which he did do make a salve of volatile salt and chrism as much as he might suffice. And he said now that he should go into that castle for to make merry with them that were there. And the traveller Leopold said that he should go otherwhither for he was a man of cautels and a subtle. Also the lady was of his avis and reproved the learning knight though she trowed well that the traveller had said thing that was false for his subtility. But the learning knight would not hear say nay nor do her mandement ne have him in aught contrarious to his list and he said how it was a marvellous castle. And the traveller Leopold went into the castle for to rest him for a space being sore of limb after many marches environing in divers lands and sometimes venery.\n\nAnd in the castle was set a board that was of the birchwood of Finlandy and it was upheld by four dwarfmen of that country but they durst not move for enchantment. And on this board were frightful swords and knives that are made in a great cavern by swinking demons out of white flames that they fix in the horns of buffalos and stags that there abound marvellously. And there were vessels that are wrought by magic of Mahound out of seasand and the air by a warlock with his breath that he blares into them like to bubbles. And full fair cheer and rich was on the board that no wight could devise a fuller ne richer. And there was a vat of silver that was moved by craft to open in the which lay strange fishes withouten heads though misbelieving men nie that this be possible thing without they see it natheless they are so. And these fishes lie in an oily water brought there from Portugal land because of the fatness that therein is like to the juices of the olive press. And also it was marvel to see in that castle how by magic they make a compost out of fecund wheat kidneys out of Chaldee that by aid of certain angry spirits that they do into it swells up wondrously like to a vast mountain. And they teach the serpents there to entwine themselves up on long sticks out of the ground and of the scales of these serpents they brew out a brewage like to mead.\n\nAnd the learning knight let pour for childe Leopold a draught and halp thereto the while all they that were there drank every each. And childe Leopold did up his beaver for to pleasure him and took apertly somewhat in amity for he never drank no manner of mead which he then put by and anon full privily he voided the more part in his neighbour glass and his neighbour wist not of his wile. And he sat down in that castle with them for to rest him there awhile. Thanked be Almighty God.`,\n\n//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n`\nNow Gandalf led the way. “We must not miss the road, or we shall be done for,” \n\n\n\n\nhe said. “We need food, for one thing, and rest in reasonable safety—also it is \nvery necessary to tackle the Misty Mountains by the proper path, or else you will \nget lost in them, and have to come back and start at the beginning again (if you \never get back at all).” \n\nThey asked him where he was making for, and he answered: “You are come \nto the very edge of the Wild, as some of you may know. Hidden somewhere \nahead of us is the fair valley of Rivendell where Elrond lives in the Last Homely \nHouse. I sent a message by my friends, and we are expected.” \n\nThat sounded nice and comforting, but they had not got there yet, and it was \nnot so easy as it sounds to find the Last Homely House west of the Mountains. \nThere seemed to be no trees and no valleys and no hills to break the ground in \nfront of them, only one vast slope going slowly up and up to meet the feet of the \nnearest mountain, a wide land the colour of heather and crumbling rock, with \npatches and slashes of grass-green and moss-green showing where water might \nbe. \n\nMorning passed, afternoon came; but in all the silent waste there was no sign \nof any dwelling. They were growing anxious, for they saw now that the house \nmight be hidden almost anywhere between them and the mountains. They came \non unexpected valleys, narrow with steep sides, that opened suddenly at their \nfeet, and they looked down surprised to see trees below them and running water \nat the bottom. There were gullies that they could almost leap over, but very deep \nwith waterfalls in them. There were dark ravines that one could neither jump \nover nor climb into. There were bogs, some of them green pleasant places to \nlook at, with flowers growing bright and tall; but a pony that walked there with a \npack on its back would never have come out again. \n\nIt was indeed a much wider land from the ford to the mountains than ever \nyou would have guessed. Bilbo was astonished. The only path was marked with \nwhite stones, some of which were small, and others were half covered with moss \nor heather. Altogether it was a very slow business following the track, even \nguided by Gandalf, who seemed to know his way about pretty well. \n\nHis head and beard wagged this way and that as he looked for the stones, and \nthey followed his lead, but they seemed no nearer to the end of the search when \nthe day began to fail. Tea-time had long gone by, and it seemed supper-time \nwould soon do the same. There were moths fluttering about, and the light \nbecame very dim, for the moon had not risen. Bilbo’s pony began to stumble \nover roots and stones. They came to the edge of a steep fall in the ground so \nsuddenly that Gandalf’s horse nearly slipped down the slope. \n\n\n\n“Here it is at last!” he called, and the others gathered round him and looked \nover the edge. They saw a valley far below. They could hear the voice of \nhurrying water in a rocky bed at the bottom; the scent of trees was in the air; and \nthere was a light on the valley-side across the water. \n\nBilbo never forgot the way they slithered and slipped in the dusk down the \nsteep zig-zag path into the secret valley of Rivendell. The air grew warmer as \nthey got lower, and the smell of the pine-trees made him drowsy, so that every \nnow and again he nodded and nearly fell off, or bumped his nose on the pony’s \nneck. Their spirits rose as they went down and down. The trees changed to beech \nand oak, and there was a comfortable feeling in the twilight. The last green had \nalmost faded out of the grass, when they came at length to an open glade not far \nabove the banks of the stream. \n\n“Hmmm! it smells like elves!” thought Bilbo, and he looked up at the stars. \nThey were burning bright and blue. Just then there came a burst of song like \nlaughter in the trees: O! What are you doing, \n\nAnd where are you going? \nYour ponies need shoeing! \nThe river is flowing! \n\nO! tra-la-la-lally \n\nhere down in the valley! \n\n\nO! What are you seeking, \nAnd where are you making ? \nThe sticks are reeking, \n\nThe bannocks are baking! \nO! tril-lil-lil-lolly \nthe valley is jolly, \nha! ha! \n\n\nO! Where are you going \nWith beards all a-wagging? \nNo knowing, no knowing \nWhat brings Mister Baggins \n\n\n\nAnd Balin and Dwalin \ndown into the valley \nin June \nha! ha! \n\n\nO! Will you be staying, \n\nOr will you be flying? \n\nYour ponies are straying! \nThe daylight is dying! \n\nTo fly would be folly, \n\nTo stay would be jolly \nAnd listen and hark \nTill the end of the dark \nto our tune \nha! ha! \n\n\nSo they laughed and sang in the trees; and pretty fair nonsense I daresay you \nthink it. Not that they would care; they would only laugh all the more if you told \nthem so. They were elves of course. Soon Bilbo caught glimpses of them as the \ndarkness deepened. He loved elves, though he seldom met them; but he was a \nlittle frightened of them too. Dwarves don’t get on well with them. Even decent \nenough dwarves like Thorin and his friends think them foolish (which is a very \nfoolish thing to think), or get annoyed with them. For some elves tease them and \nlaugh at them, and most of all at their beards. \n\n“Well, well!” said a voice. “Just look! Bilbo the hobbit on a pony, my dear! \nIsn’t it delicious!” \n\n“Most astonishing wonderful!” \n\nThen off they went into another song as ridiculous as the one I have written \ndown in full. At last one, a tall young fellow, came out from the trees and bowed \nto Gandalf and to Thorin. \n\n“Welcome to the valley!” he said. \n\n“Thank you!” said Thorin a bit gruffly; but Gandalf was already off his horse \nand among the elves, talking merrily with them. \n\n“You are a little out of your way,” said the elf: “that is, if you are making for \nthe only path across the water and to the house beyond. We will set you right, \nbut you had best get on foot, until you are over the bridge. Are you going to stay \n\n\n\na bit and sing with us, or will you go straight on? Supper is preparing over \nthere,” he said. “I can smell the wood-fires for the cooking.” Tired as he was, Bilbo would have liked to stay a while. Elvish singing is not \na thing to miss, in June under the stars, not if you care for such things. Also he \nwould have liked to have a few private words with these people that seemed to \nknow his names and all about him, although he had never seen them before. He \nthought their opinion of his adventure might be interesting. Elves know a lot and \nare wondrous folk for news, and know what is going on among the peoples of \nthe land, as quick as water flows, or quicker. \n\nBut the dwarves were all for supper as soon as possible just then, and would \nnot stay. On they all went, leading their ponies, till they were brought to a good \npath and so at last to the very brink of the river. It was flowing fast and noisily, \nas mountain-streams do of a summer evening, when sun has been all day on the \nsnow far up above. There was only a narrow bridge of stone without a parapet, \nas narrow as a pony could well walk on; and over that they had to go, slow and \ncareful, one by one, each leading his pony by the bridle. The elves had brought \nbright lanterns to the shore, and they sang a merry song as the party went across. \n\n“Don’t dip your beard in the foam, father!” they cried to Thorin, who was \nbent almost on to his hands and knees. “It is long enough without watering it.” \n\n“Mind Bilbo doesn’t eat all the cakes!” they called. “He is too fat to get \nthrough key-holes yet!” \n\n“Hush, hush! Good People! and good night!” said Gandalf, who came last. \n“Valleys have ears, and some elves have over merry tongues. Good night!” \n\nAnd so at last they all came to the Last Homely House, and found its doors \nflung wide. \n\n\nNow it is a strange thing, but things that are good to have and days that are \ngood to spend are soon told about, and not much to listen to; while things that \nare uncomfortable, palpitating, and even gruesome, may make a good tale, and \ntake a deal of telling anyway. They stayed long in that good house, fourteen days \nat least, and they found it hard to leave. Bilbo would gladly have stopped there \nfor ever and ever—even supposing a wish would have taken him right back to \nhis hobbit-hole without trouble. Yet there is little to tell about their stay. \n\nThe master of the house was an elf-friend—one of those people whose \nfathers came into the strange stories before the beginning of History, the wars of \nthe evil goblins and the elves and the first men in the North. In those days of our \n\n\n\ntale there were still some people who had both elves and heroes of the North for \nancestors, and Elrond the master of the house was their chief. \n\n`,\n//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n`Now to the obverse.
