For who is there who anything of some significance has apprehended but is conscious that that exterior splendour may be the surface of a downwardtending lutulent reality or on the contrary anyone so is there inilluminated as not to perceive that as no nature's boon can contend against the bounty of increase so it behoves every most just citizen to become the exhortator and admonisher of his semblables and to tremble lest what had in the past been by the nation excellently commenced might be in the future not with similar excellence accomplished if an inverecund habit shall have gradually traduced the honourable by ancestors transmitted customs to that thither of profundity that that one was audacious excessively who would have the hardihood to rise affirming that no more odious offence can for anyone be than to oblivious neglect to consign that evangel simultaneously command and promise which on all mortals with prophecy of abundance or with diminution's menace that exalted of reiteratedly procreating function ever irrevocably enjoined?\n\nIt is not why therefore we shall wonder if, as the best historians relate, among the Celts, who nothing that was not in its nature admirable admired, the art of medicine shall have been highly honoured.

Certainly in every public work which in it anything of gravity contains preparation should be with importance commensurate and therefore a plan was by them adopted (whether by having preconsidered or as the maturation of experience it is difficult in being said which the discrepant opinions of subsequent inquirers are not up to the present congrued to render manifest) whereby maternity was so far from all accident possibility removed that whatever care the patient in that allhardest of woman hour chiefly required and not solely for the copiously opulent but also for her who not being sufficiently moneyed scarcely and often not even scarcely could subsist valiantly and for an inconsiderable emolument was provided.\n\nTo her nothing already then and thenceforward was anyway able to be molestful for this chiefly felt all citizens except with proliferent mothers prosperity at all not to can be and as they had received eternity gods mortals generation to befit them her beholding, when the case was so having itself, parturient in vehicle the reward carrying desire immense among all one another was impelling on of her to be received into that domicile.

Of Israel's folk was that man that on earth wandering far had fared. Stark ruth of man his errand that him lone led till that house.\n\nOf that house A. Horne is lord. Seventy beds keeps he there teeming mothers are wont that they lie for to thole and bring forth bairns hale so God's angel to Mary quoth. Watchers they there walk, white sisters in ward sleepless. Smarts they still sickness soothing: in twelve moons thrice an hundred. Truest bedthanes they twain are, for Horne holding wariest ward.\n\nIn ward wary the watcher hearing come that man mild-hearted eft rising with swire ywimpled to him her gate wide undid. Lo, levin leaping lightens in eyeblink Ireland's westward welkin! Full she dread that God the Wreaker all mankind would fordo with water for his evil sins. Christ's rood made she on breastbone and him drew that he would rathe infare under her thatch. That man her will wotting worthful went in Horne's house.\n\nLoth to irk in Horne's hall hat holding the seeker stood. On her stow he ere was living with dear wife and lovesome daughter that then over land and seafloor nine year had long outwandered. Once her in townhithe meeting he to her bow had not doffed. Her to forgive now he craved with good ground of her allowed that that of him swiftseen face, hers, so young then had looked. Light swift her eyes kindled, bloom of blushes his word winning.\n\nAs her eyes then ongot his weeds swart therefor sorrow she feared. Glad after she was that ere adread was. Her he asked if O'Hare Doctor tidings sent from far coast and she with grameful sigh him answered that O'Hare Doctor in heaven was. Sad was the man that word to hear that him so heavied in bowels ruthful. All she there told him, ruing death for friend so young, algate sore unwilling God's rightwiseness to withsay. She said that he had a fair sweet death through God His goodness with masspriest to be shriven, holy housel and sick men's oil to his limbs. The man then right earnest asked the nun of which death the dead man was died and the nun answered him and said that he was died in Mona island through bellycrab three year agone come Childermas and she prayed to God the Allruthful to have his dear soul in his undeathliness. He heard her sad words, in held hat sad staring. So stood they there both awhile in wanhope, sorrowing one with other.\n\nTherefore, everyman, look to that last end that is thy death and the dust that gripeth on every man that is born of woman for as he came naked forth from his mother's womb so naked shall he wend him at the last for to go as he came.\n\nThe man that was come into the house then spoke to the nursingwoman and he asked her how it fared with the woman that lay there in childbed. The nursingwoman answered him and said that that woman was in throes now full three days and that it would be a hard birth unneth to bear but that now in a little it would be. She said thereto that she had seen many births of women but never was none so hard as was that woman's birth. Then she set it forth all to him that time was had lived nigh that house. The man hearkened to her words for he felt with wonder women's woe in the travail that they have of motherhood and he wondered to look on her face that was a young face for any man to see but yet was she left after long years a handmaid. Nine twelve bloodflows chiding her childless.\n\nAnd whiles they spake the door of the castle was opened and there nighed them a mickle noise as of many that sat there at meat. And there came against the place as they stood a young learning knight yclept Dixon. And the traveller Leopold was couth to him sithen it had happed that they had had ado each with other in the house of misericord where this learning knight lay by cause the traveller Leopold came there to be healed for he was sore wounded in his breast by a spear wherewith a horrible and dreadful dragon was smitten him for which he did do make a salve of volatile salt and chrism as much as he might suffice. And he said now that he should go into that castle for to make merry with them that were there. And the traveller Leopold said that he should go otherwhither for he was a man of cautels and a subtle. Also the lady was of his avis and reproved the learning knight though she trowed well that the traveller had said thing that was false for his subtility. But the learning knight would not hear say nay nor do her mandement ne have him in aught contrarious to his list and he said how it was a marvellous castle. And the traveller Leopold went into the castle for to rest him for a space being sore of limb after many marches environing in divers lands and sometimes venery.\n\nAnd in the castle was set a board that was of the birchwood of Finlandy and it was upheld by four dwarfmen of that country but they durst not move for enchantment. And on this board were frightful swords and knives that are made in a great cavern by swinking demons out of white flames that they fix in the horns of buffalos and stags that there abound marvellously. And there were vessels that are wrought by magic of Mahound out of seasand and the air by a warlock with his breath that he blares into them like to bubbles. And full fair cheer and rich was on the board that no wight could devise a fuller ne richer. And there was a vat of silver that was moved by craft to open in the which lay strange fishes withouten heads though misbelieving men nie that this be possible thing without they see it natheless they are so. And these fishes lie in an oily water brought there from Portugal land because of the fatness that therein is like to the juices of the olive press. And also it was marvel to see in that castle how by magic they make a compost out of fecund wheat kidneys out of Chaldee that by aid of certain angry spirits that they do into it swells up wondrously like to a vast mountain. And they teach the serpents there to entwine themselves up on long sticks out of the ground and of the scales of these serpents they brew out a brewage like to mead.\n\nAnd the learning knight let pour for childe Leopold a draught and halp thereto the while all they that were there drank every each. And childe Leopold did up his beaver for to pleasure him and took apertly somewhat in amity for he never drank no manner of mead which he then put by and anon full privily he voided the more part in his neighbour glass and his neighbour wist not of his wile. And he sat down in that castle with them for to rest him there awhile. Thanked be Almighty God.","\nNow Gandalf led the way. \u201cWe must not miss the road, or we shall be done for,\u201d \n\n\n\n\nhe said. \u201cWe need food, for one thing, and rest in reasonable safety\u2014also it is \nvery necessary to tackle the Misty Mountains by the proper path, or else you will \nget lost in them, and have to come back and start at the beginning again (if you \never get back at all).\u201d \n\nThey asked him where he was making for, and he answered: \u201cYou are come \nto the very edge of the Wild, as some of you may know. Hidden somewhere \nahead of us is the fair valley of Rivendell where Elrond lives in the Last Homely \nHouse. I sent a message by my friends, and we are expected.\u201d \n\nThat sounded nice and comforting, but they had not got there yet, and it was \nnot so easy as it sounds to find the Last Homely House west of the Mountains. \nThere seemed to be no trees and no valleys and no hills to break the ground in \nfront of them, only one vast slope going slowly up and up to meet the feet of the \nnearest mountain, a wide land the colour of heather and crumbling rock, with \npatches and slashes of grass-green and moss-green showing where water might \nbe. \n\nMorning passed, afternoon came; but in all the silent waste there was no sign \nof any dwelling. They were growing anxious, for they saw now that the house \nmight be hidden almost anywhere between them and the mountains. They came \non unexpected valleys, narrow with steep sides, that opened suddenly at their \nfeet, and they looked down surprised to see trees below them and running water \nat the bottom. There were gullies that they could almost leap over, but very deep \nwith waterfalls in them. There were dark ravines that one could neither jump \nover nor climb into. There were bogs, some of them green pleasant places to \nlook at, with flowers growing bright and tall; but a pony that walked there with a \npack on its back would never have come out again. \n\nIt was indeed a much wider land from the ford to the mountains than ever \nyou would have guessed. Bilbo was astonished. The only path was marked with \nwhite stones, some of which were small, and others were half covered with moss \nor heather. Altogether it was a very slow business following the track, even \nguided by Gandalf, who seemed to know his way about pretty well. \n\nHis head and beard wagged this way and that as he looked for the stones, and \nthey followed his lead, but they seemed no nearer to the end of the search when \nthe day began to fail. Tea-time had long gone by, and it seemed supper-time \nwould soon do the same. There were moths fluttering about, and the light \nbecame very dim, for the moon had not risen. Bilbo\u2019s pony began to stumble \nover roots and stones. They came to the edge of a steep fall in the ground so \nsuddenly that Gandalf\u2019s horse nearly slipped down the slope. \n\n\n\n\u201cHere it is at last!\u201d he called, and the others gathered round him and looked \nover the edge. They saw a valley far below. They could hear the voice of \nhurrying water in a rocky bed at the bottom; the scent of trees was in the air; and \nthere was a light on the valley-side across the water. \n\nBilbo never forgot the way they slithered and slipped in the dusk down the \nsteep zig-zag path into the secret valley of Rivendell. The air grew warmer as \nthey got lower, and the smell of the pine-trees made him drowsy, so that every \nnow and again he nodded and nearly fell off, or bumped his nose on the pony\u2019s \nneck. Their spirits rose as they went down and down. The trees changed to beech \nand oak, and there was a comfortable feeling in the twilight. The last green had \nalmost faded out of the grass, when they came at length to an open glade not far \nabove the banks of the stream. \n\n\u201cHmmm! it smells like elves!\u201d thought Bilbo, and he looked up at the stars. \nThey were burning bright and blue. Just then there came a burst of song like \nlaughter in the trees: O! What are you doing, \n\nAnd where are you going? \nYour ponies need shoeing! \nThe river is flowing! \n\nO! tra-la-la-lally \n\nhere down in the valley! \n\n\nO! What are you seeking, \nAnd where are you making ? \nThe sticks are reeking, \n\nThe bannocks are baking! \nO! tril-lil-lil-lolly \nthe valley is jolly, \nha! ha! \n\n\nO! Where are you going \nWith beards all a-wagging? \nNo knowing, no knowing \nWhat brings Mister Baggins \n\n\n\nAnd Balin and Dwalin \ndown into the valley \nin June \nha! ha! \n\n\nO! Will you be staying, \n\nOr will you be flying? \n\nYour ponies are straying! \nThe daylight is dying! \n\nTo fly would be folly, \n\nTo stay would be jolly \nAnd listen and hark \nTill the end of the dark \nto our tune \nha! ha! \n\n\nSo they laughed and sang in the trees; and pretty fair nonsense I daresay you \nthink it. Not that they would care; they would only laugh all the more if you told \nthem so. They were elves of course. Soon Bilbo caught glimpses of them as the \ndarkness deepened. He loved elves, though he seldom met them; but he was a \nlittle frightened of them too. Dwarves don\u2019t get on well with them. Even decent \nenough dwarves like Thorin and his friends think them foolish (which is a very \nfoolish thing to think), or get annoyed with them. For some elves tease them and \nlaugh at them, and most of all at their beards. \n\n\u201cWell, well!\u201d said a voice. \u201cJust look! Bilbo the hobbit on a pony, my dear! \nIsn\u2019t it delicious!\u201d \n\n\u201cMost astonishing wonderful!\u201d \n\nThen off they went into another song as ridiculous as the one I have written \ndown in full. At last one, a tall young fellow, came out from the trees and bowed \nto Gandalf and to Thorin. \n\n\u201cWelcome to the valley!\u201d he said. \n\n\u201cThank you!\u201d said Thorin a bit gruffly; but Gandalf was already off his horse \nand among the elves, talking merrily with them. \n\n\u201cYou are a little out of your way,\u201d said the elf: \u201cthat is, if you are making for \nthe only path across the water and to the house beyond. We will set you right, \nbut you had best get on foot, until you are over the bridge. Are you going to stay \n\n\n\na bit and sing with us, or will you go straight on? Supper is preparing over \nthere,\u201d he said. \u201cI can smell the wood-fires for the cooking.\u201d Tired as he was, Bilbo would have liked to stay a while. Elvish singing is not \na thing to miss, in June under the stars, not if you care for such things. Also he \nwould have liked to have a few private words with these people that seemed to \nknow his names and all about him, although he had never seen them before. He \nthought their opinion of his adventure might be interesting. Elves know a lot and \nare wondrous folk for news, and know what is going on among the peoples of \nthe land, as quick as water flows, or quicker. \n\nBut the dwarves were all for supper as soon as possible just then, and would \nnot stay. On they all went, leading their ponies, till they were brought to a good \npath and so at last to the very brink of the river. It was flowing fast and noisily, \nas mountain-streams do of a summer evening, when sun has been all day on the \nsnow far up above. There was only a narrow bridge of stone without a parapet, \nas narrow as a pony could well walk on; and over that they had to go, slow and \ncareful, one by one, each leading his pony by the bridle. The elves had brought \nbright lanterns to the shore, and they sang a merry song as the party went across. \n\n\u201cDon\u2019t dip your beard in the foam, father!\u201d they cried to Thorin, who was \nbent almost on to his hands and knees. \u201cIt is long enough without watering it.\u201d \n\n\u201cMind Bilbo doesn\u2019t eat all the cakes!\u201d they called. \u201cHe is too fat to get \nthrough key-holes yet!\u201d \n\n\u201cHush, hush! Good People! and good night!\u201d said Gandalf, who came last. \n\u201cValleys have ears, and some elves have over merry tongues. Good night!\u201d \n\nAnd so at last they all came to the Last Homely House, and found its doors \nflung wide. \n\n\nNow it is a strange thing, but things that are good to have and days that are \ngood to spend are soon told about, and not much to listen to; while things that \nare uncomfortable, palpitating, and even gruesome, may make a good tale, and \ntake a deal of telling anyway. They stayed long in that good house, fourteen days \nat least, and they found it hard to leave. Bilbo would gladly have stopped there \nfor ever and ever\u2014even supposing a wish would have taken him right back to \nhis hobbit-hole without trouble. Yet there is little to tell about their stay. \n\nThe master of the house was an elf-friend\u2014one of those people whose \nfathers came into the strange stories before the beginning of History, the wars of \nthe evil goblins and the elves and the first men in the North. In those days of our \n\n\n\ntale there were still some people who had both elves and heroes of the North for \nancestors, and Elrond the master of the house was their chief. \n\n","Now to the obverse.

To see my technical frontend demonstrations, open library."],"neural_mirrors.txt":["A neural network, the family AI algorithms that run many modern recommendation and computer vision systems, is just a really good function approximator. It never gets the exact representation of the function \u2013 even nature can\u2019t do that \u2013 but it often gets closer than any other methods we have come up with. This function could be that which determines what YouTube videos you would be most inclined to watch next. Its inputs would be what you have previously watched, and its outputs would be the videos that show up in your recommendation feed. Imagine a blurry image increasing in clarity as the function approaches a better approximation, or your increasing understanding as you get better at a certain skill.","Inputs are thrown into the function and transformed into whatever the outputs may be. This idea of functions representing transformations \u2013 your YouTube watch history (input) \u2192 your YouTube recommendation feed (output) \u2013 is immensely powerful because it can be used to model basically everything going on in the world, and the success of neural networks is representative of that idea. (Wittgenstein, Plato, theory of forms?)","Aside from being a neat and useful set of algorithms, I think neural networks are mathematical analogs to the biological mechanisms which govern our minds and bodies. There are countless methods and techniques that go into the training and creation of these networks that have an uncanny symmetry with our own best methods of learning and ways of thinking. A thorough understanding of the systems which make successful neural networks may yield a similar understanding of our own biological systems.","Perception is one such concept embedded deep within the symmetries between ourselves and neural networks. Physically, one\u2019s perspective is a matter of where they stand in the real world. But this concept of perception also carries over to the way we think about things. Phrases like \u201cI see what you mean\u201d are explicit expressions linking our own concept of perception and the understanding of another\u2019s ideas. ","Perception changes when we ourselves move around, or when we manipulate the subject at hand. In high school geometry, we learn about things like translations (sliding things around), rotations, and reflections. These transformations are actions used to manipulate a given shape and can be used to give a new perspective to it. We can rotate a Rubik\u2019s Cube to uncover a previously hidden red-colored side; reflect ( reflect | tcelfer ) a word to defamiliarize the familiar.","The fundamental mathematical operation of neural networks deals entirely with perspective. Simple neural networks are essentially a series of matrices by which an input is multiplied. An input goes in as one matrix and leaves the other side as another. Coincidentally, geometric transformations are often represented in matrices to accommodate higher dimensions. One could use matrices to increase the dimensionality of another matrix (e.g. 3D \u2192 6D), or, in a perspective frame of mind, the same object looked at with different variables. The latter part of the previous sentence is itself representative of this idea, in that framing the increasing of dimensionality in perspectives is the same concept, composed differently. In other words, a simple neural network can be thought of as a series of internal perspectives of the input. Each successive multiplication between the network and the input yields a new matrix, one whose shape and numbers may be different while still representing the idea originally presented to the network in the input. The output is the final perspective, the input through the eyes of the algorithm.","Our perspective regarding any topic is a measure of how much we have learned about it and our confidence in what we have learned. A small town prodigy could enter the big city only to be crushed by more universally prodigious individuals. A competitive grandmaster seizes with great confidence opportunities forever lost on those outside of the game. A solitary hobbyist could have an unrivaled expertise, unbeknownst to himself and the rest of the world.","This perspective is expanded through experience and learning. Expert opinions matter because they are borne of years of experience\u2013knowledge gained only through exposure. To read and understand is different than to think[1] and understand. The former yields foreign connections unnatural to your existing mind; the latter yields an organic perspective cultivated from the fruits of your own interpretation. To learn something is to see it differently. To learn something is to add to one\u2019s repertoire those perspectives that allow you to see more clearly that which may have been previously invisible.","In training a neural network, it behooves the practitioner to use as large a dataset as possible. In other words, provide as diverse a set of experiences to the model as you possibly can. This usually increases the performance of the model in its native domain as well as its generalizability to unfamiliar data. It expands the perspective of the model. The model which sees more is the model that is capable of more. It scores higher on tests. It produces more consistent and robust results in the face of uncertainty or unfamiliarity. Unless experimental results suggest otherwise, one should always strive for the largest dataset possible.","Some of the most influential people in history had a record of cultivating many intellectual pursuits. Various rulers of the Renaissance \u2013 Ferrante of Naples, the Medici family of Florence, Mehmed the Conqueror of the Ottoman Empire \u2013 dumped enormous sums of money into the copying and preservation of ancient manuscripts. Great mercenary warlord, Federico da Montefeltro, had ambitions to assemble a library \u201cso vast, and so select, / As to supply each intellect and taste,\u201d (Quoted in James Dennistoun, Memoirs of the Dukes of Urbino, vol. 1, p. 164). The personal libraries of these rulers were boasted to be among the best in the world. Many of the pioneering 20th century physicists invested themselves heavily in humanities to accompany their scientific inquiry. Robert Oppenheimer spent his free time reading and writing poetry like, for example, the Bhagavad Gita in its native Sanskrit. Einstein famously played violin at a world-class level. Max Planck was similarly talented on the piano.","In working toward set goals, one should be careful not to forget the vision which started the goal in the first place. Ruling dynasties may start with the intention of securing their family\u2019s power as well as empowering their native people, only to fall into moral decay and political impotence after a few generations. Similarly, on a shorter timescale and with fewer consequences, one might set out to do their homework on the computer, only to get lost in a labyrinth of capitalist attention traps. Those who successfully avoid such things often have signals, internal or otherwise, set up to remind them of their origin. A memoir, message, or similarly sentimental object or memory to serve as a reminder to stay focused on their mission, lest they lose their way and fall into darkness. ","Predictably, successful neural networks have a similar mechanism for boosting performance during and after training. In a simple network, as discussed before, it may just be a series of matrices by which the input is multiplied. A slightly more complex, and likely more successful, version might introduce the concept of residuals, which add to the result of a matrix multiplication the previous input. In adding the input to the output, we are left with a cumulation of the two. The end result builds on the previous ideas, but doesn\u2019t increase complexity. The dimensionality of perspective is unchanged. Rather, it serves as an explicit remnant of the network\u2019s previous thoughts. A residual signal of the original perspective that initiated the thinking and doing.","In training a neural network, we are guiding it around a hugely multidimensional object, the shape of which can only be determined through myriad perspectives. Likewise, in learning something we are taking ourselves through many different perspectives, integrating (with varying degrees) the perspectives of both our predecessors and our own observations.","[1]: To think and understand refers to the action of actively doing and/or thinking through something. This uses the assumption that in deliberately doing something, you\u2019re actively thinking about what you\u2019re doing."],"test_essay.txt":["Random filler essay to test having several different essays to choose from the top.","A few weeks ago, I got obsessed with the idea of fractility in nature, both physically and abstractly. The idea of repeating patterns in different areas seemed absolutely amazing because I felt like I had been seeing it all my life. That, and having seen things before relating fractalism and architecture (source to come), led me to the following tweet:",'"A solution exists to a problem iff both the solution and problem exist elsewhere in a different context and I refuse to believe anything otherwise."','Essentially, this means that every "problem" (goal, objective) and "solution" (means by which you achieve the goal/objective) is already there, just in a different context. Aptly solving your own problems means mapping problem/solution pairs from other domains to your own. The inability to do so either means that the problem/solution pair doesn\'t exist, or you just haven\'t found the mapping/right pair yet.','This relates a bit to Plato\'s Theory of Forms, where every object/idea/concept/whatever has a "form" that links all of whatever object/idea/concept/whatever together. For example, we know that tables generally have some kind of supports (legs, but not always) to stand on as well as a surface on which things can rest. But the details for each and every table can vary so widely that it\'s impossible to totally categorize every single type of table. In fact, I think this inability to totally categorize every facet of a "form" is in itself a form. This inability crops up as a complaint of literally every attempt to categorize things. Most prominent examples that come to mind are stereotypes of people and the sciences.','I think Ludwig Wittgenstein inadvertantly wrote about this in his Tractatus Logico-Philosophus with his first statement: "The world is everything that is the case." Nothing more can be stated about the world which isn\'t already stated. John Gall repeated this sentiment, in more straightforward terms, in his treatise on systems engineering, Systemantics: The Systems Bible, "The system is its own best explanation."',"In a way this is similar to Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle in quantum physics, which essentially means that the more preciesly we know a particle's position, the less precisely we know that same particle's momentum, and vice versa. Mapped to the context of our current discussion, I believe it means that [more topic precision takes away from generalizability, and vice versa? still not sure yet].","Is this generally useful? I have no idea. At the very least, it has given me the confidence to tackle basically any problem without fear of total failure. After all, it does imply that excellence in one field means the possibility of excellence in another. On the other hand, it could just be the abstract nonsense for which philosophers are most commonly hated. Regardless this is going to be something I will continue thinking about as I have found it most useful and would like to extract a more practical application for
